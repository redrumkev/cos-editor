# COS Editor Specification

The canonical specification lives in the NEXUS federal repository:

**`~/dev/NEXUS/vision/cos/cos_editor-spec.md`**

This file is the single source of truth for:
- Editor architecture and UI vision
- Three-layer book model (Dossier / Manuscript / Telemetry)
- Move plans and implementation decisions
- Backend integration points

Move 15 beads are tracked in this repo's `.beads/` directory.
See `bd list --label move-15` for current status.
